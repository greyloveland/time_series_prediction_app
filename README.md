### Time Series Forecasting App
This interactive Streamlit app enables users to perform time series forecasting using a wide range of models including Naive, ETS, ARIMA, Random Forest, RNN, LSTM, and XGBoost. It supports flexible data input, model configuration, and performance comparison through automated metrics and visualizations.

### Features
Upload CSVs, use built-in datasets, or pull stock data from Yahoo Finance

Supports multiple forecasting models with adjustable hyperparameters

Visualizes training, testing, and forecast results

Computes MAE, RMSE, and MAPE for model evaluation

Interactive UI built using Streamlit

Supported Models
Naive

ETS (Exponential Smoothing)

ARIMA

Random Forest

RNN

LSTM

XGBoost
